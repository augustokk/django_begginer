Adding CSS and Javascript to the project

STEP 1:
In the folder tasks (inside of folder todo) we are going to add a new folder called static
In the folder static we are going to add 2 new folders
- css (for css content)
- js (for javascript content)

STEP 2:
In the folder css we are going to add a new file called: styles.css
in that file we will put some code just to check if it is properly working:

h1{
    color:red;
}

In the folder js we are going to add a new file called: scripts.js
in that file we will put some code just to check if it is properly working:

console.log('working!');

STEP 3:
now on the file base.html we are going to do some changes to connect that files
in the first line of the file before the doctype we add that piece of code:

{% load static %}  <!-- that will allow django to load static files -->

in the head section we add that piece of code:

     <!-- that will connect our base.html to the css on static folder-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">

at end of the body section we add that piece of code:

     <!-- that will connect our base.html to the javascript on static folder-->
    <script src="{% static 'js/scripts.js' %}" > </script>

STEP 4:
To check if is working we run the server 
- On terminal at pycharm at the specific location (projeto-todo\todo)
- run command (python .\manage.py runserver)
- as ouput of the command will shown an url, when you click it opens the browser with the specific content of the template 

navigation bar
List of tasks (on red) --CSS WORKING FINE
footer

then you click on inspect -- console
the message working! should appear

STEP 5:
to make our design a bit easier and more professional we are going to use the tool called bootstrap
For that we are going to connect our files using CDN
- go to the bootstrap website (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- check for include via cdn
- you will find 2 codes to copy, in my case:

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-KK94CHFLLe+nY2dmCWGMq91rCGa5gtU4mk92HdvYe+M/SXH301p5ILy+dN9+nJOZ" crossorigin="anonymous">

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ENjdO4Dr2bkBIFxQpeoTz1HIcje39Wm4jDKdf19U8gI4ddQ3GYNS7NTKfAdVQSZe" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

- as we did previously in that step, we include the tab link in the head section on base.html
- as we did previously in that step, we include the tab script in the end of the body section on base.html

[*you can check if that changes worked running server again, the layout of letter font should change]

STEP 6:
The idea of using bootstrap is separating it in containers to easy apply the changes 
- in the body section we are going to add a div tag of the class container
- we are goingo to separate the footer in a proper tag
- for the navigation bar we are going to copy the code from bootstrap website  (on the components sections you have many different options for all the necessary implementations you need)
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/
- after copying that code we are going to eliminate some elements that we dont need, also we are going to indent it properly
- check the code:

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
            <div class="container-fluid">
                <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">To Do</a>
                <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
                </button>
                <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
                    <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
                        <li class="nav-item">
                            <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Tasks</a>
                        </li>
                        <li class="nav-item">
                            <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Users</a>
                        </li>
                        <li class="nav-item">
                            <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">About us</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </nav>
        {% block content %}
        {% endblock %}
        <footer>
            footer
        </footer>
    </div>
    <!-- that will connect our base.html to the javascript on static folder-->
    <script src="{% static 'js/scripts.js' %}">  </script>
    <!-- that will connect our base.html to bootstrap via cdn-->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ENjdO4Dr2bkBIFxQpeoTz1HIcje39Wm4jDKdf19U8gI4ddQ3GYNS7NTKfAdVQSZe" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</body>
