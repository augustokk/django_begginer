That step still part of our CRUD
In that step we are going to add the path, the view and the template for the user be able to delete the tasks

STEP 1:
at file urls.py (tasks > urls.py)
- we are going to add a new path to be able to delete tasks
- in that path is necessary to identify using th primary key (id) to avoid delete wrong task

STEP 2:
on the views.py (todo > tasks >views.py)
- we create a new function called deleteTask
- to collect the specific task using the id and with the form filled to present to the user
- check if there is popullated data

STEP 3:
on the tasks (todo > tasks > templates > tasks)
- create a file deletetask.html


STEP 4:
on list.html (todo > tasks > templates > tasks >list.html)
- we add an ahref on the delete button to direct it for the url to delete task

STEP 5:
Create a session image to show that you propely deleted the task
on the views.py (todo > tasks >views.py)
- import messages
- add code to the function deleteTask  --> messages.info(request, 'Task Deleted successfully!')


STEP 6:
on list.html (todo > tasks > templates > tasks >list.html)
- we set a space where the delete message will show up
- check if there is a message
- use for loop to collect all messages
- print message as list item

STEP 7:
on the styles.css (todo > tasks> statis > css> styles.css)
- style the elements of the li created to show message
