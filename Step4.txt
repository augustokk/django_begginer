We are going to extend the template, to make easier to keep the pattern different pages

STEP 1:
create a html file under the templates (as all the pages are going to use it) called base.html
we are going to create a real simple code for the moment, just to start

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <!-- django allow to use it to get specific templates for each page -->
    <!-- we need to use the formatting {% block name %} {% endblock %} -->
    <title>{% block title %} {% endblock %} </title>  
</head>
<body>
    <p> navigation bar</p>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
    <p> footer</p>

</body>
</html>

STEP 2:
we will modify the other html files that we already built to receive that base template
- list.html

{% extends 'base.html' %}   <!-- that will collect the base template data-->

{% block title %} List of tasks {% endblock %}  <!-- that will give a specific title for the page -->

{% block content %} <!-- that will give a specific content for the page -->
    <h1>List of tasks</h1>
{% endblock %}


-yourname.html
{% extends 'base.html' %}   <!-- that will collect the base template data-->

{% block title %} Your name {% endblock %}  <!-- that will give a specific title for the page -->

{% block content %} <!-- that will give a specific content for the page -->
    <h1>Your name is: {{name}}</h1>
{% endblock %}

STEP 3:
To check if is working we run the server (tasks.html)
- On terminal at pycharm at the specific location (projeto-todo\todo)
- run command (python .\manage.py runserver)
- as ouput of the command will shown an url, when you click it opens the browser with the specific content of the template 

navigation bar
List of tasks
footer

- in my scenario the url was:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- if you type on the browser http://localhost:8000/, you will get the same

STEP 4:
Now we are going to check if it is working yourname.html
in the browser with any of the open pages
-http://127.0.0.1:8000/
-http://localhost:8000/
 we add yourname/augusto
example:
http://localhost:8000/yourname/augusto

The output on browser should be:

navigation bar
Your name is: augusto
footer
