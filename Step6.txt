-At this stage instead of using pycharm i started to use visual studio code
Because the interaction with css and javascript is more user friendly at visual studio code
That step is much about adding some style to the project
Based on that there is no much steps to follow one-by-one
You can check how that STEP 6 finishes on the branch step6 if you have any doubt

in that step we are going to do a bit more about layout of our system

STEP 1:
at the base.html file
- we make the div container as fluid to take all the space of the page
- add a paragraph into the footer


STEP 2:
at list.html we are adding more elements and adding bootstrap
we are also going to use the font awesome to built the layout
-for that you go for the website [https://fontawesome.com/] 
-You will need setup a new account
-that will generate a unique code to copy in your file
-we add that code on base.html
-in the head section
-under the link of bootstrap 

STEP 3:
at the styles.css file we are going to add some styles
