Step 1 : open cmd
run command (cd testevenv) [we are using same as first step but you can create a new directory if wish]
run command (mkdir projeto-todo) [that will create a new project *projeto-todo can be any name]
run command (cd projeto-todo) [that will move you into the projeto-todo]
run command (virtualenv venvtodo) [that will create your virtual environment]
run command (venvtodo\Scripts\activate) [that will activate the virtual environment]
run command (pip install django) [that will install django on that virtual environment]
run command (django-admin startproject todo) [that will start our project todo]

Step 2 : open your editor
In my case i am using pycharm
First I create a new project (file -> new project)
Then i selected the specific location where my directory [testevenv] is, and click create

Step 3:
In pycharm i open the folder todo as we created earlier
Go to the terminal
run command (cd projeto-todo) [that will move you into the projeto-todo]
run command (venvtodo\Scripts\activate) [that will activate the virtual environment]
run command (cd todo) [that will move you into the todo]
run command (django-admin startapp tasks)
run command (django-admin startapp about)
run command (django-admin startapp users)

***IMPORTANT*** in django we create 1 project and that project can have many apps
#EXAMPLE the project is 1 : projeto-todo and the apps are: tasks / about / users


Step 4:
in the folder todo we go for the file settings.py
under the list INSTALLED_APPS we will add our new app created:

    'tasks',
    'about',
    'users',


STEP 5:
in the folder tasks we are going to create a python file called urls.py
now we can copy the code from the folder todo the already existent urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]


now we apply some changes to it:

# from django.contrib import admin [that line just need to be called once on project, not in all apps, so we comment it or delete]
from django.urls import path
from . import views # add this line to import from views
urlpatterns = [
    path('helloworld/', views.helloworld), #here we change the path because we are going to call the helloworld, frow views
]



STEP 6:
in the folder tasks we go for the python file views.py
we are ging to add this code:


from django.http import HttpResponse #need to import specific library
from django.shortcuts import render

 #that is the function we are creating called helloworld that will output the specific message, [REMEMBER]helloworld is the name we are using at urls.py 

def helloworld(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello World!')

STEP 7:
in the folder todo [remember this is the folder of the project]
in the file urls.py
we change the code to:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include # we add the include library

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('tasks.urls')) # we include specific path for tasks.url
]

STEP 8:
in the terminal of pycharm (editor) 
run command (python .\manage.py runserver)

STEP 9:
In your browser type localhost:8000/helloworld on the url
Then that message Hello World! that we created of the function helloworld will show up on the screen
