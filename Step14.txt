In that step we are going to work on login / logout

on the todo folder we add at the urls.py the path:
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),

on the todo folder we rewrite a piece of code under settings.py 
	on the templates list we change the DIRS to 
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],

at end of file create the url to redirect the user to specific page
	LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
	LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/accounts/login'

on todo folder we create a templates folder, then inside of it we create a registration folder
inside that registration folder we create login.html file

we also added at the views.py file the loginrequired function on each view to restrict the unauthorized view
