That step still part of our CRUD
In that step we are going to add the path, the view and the template for the user be able to update the tasks

STEP 1:
at file urls.py (tasks > urls.py)
- we are going to add a new path to be able to update tasks
- in that path is necessary to identify using th primary key (id) to avoid updtae wrong task

STEP 2:
on the views.py (todo > tasks >views.py)
- we create a new function called editTask
- to collect the specific task using the id and with the form filled to present to the user
- check if there is popullated data

STEP 3:
on the tasks (todo > tasks > templates > tasks)
- create a file edittask.html
- the code is almost the same as the one for add task with just small changes from add to edit 

STEP 4:
on list.html (todo > tasks > templates > tasks >list.html)
- we add an ahref on the edit button to direct it for the url to edit task
