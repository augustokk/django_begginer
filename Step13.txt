In that step we are going to give functionality for our search button

STEP 1:
on list.html (todo > tasks > templates > tasks >list.html)
- create a specific form for the search
- update the input of search to have a value 

STEP 2:
on scripts.js (todo > tasks> statis > js >scripts.js)
- create variables for search icon and search form
- create function when search icon is clicked, activates the submit of search form

STEP 3:
on the views.py (todo > tasks >views.py)
- we need update the taskList function
- we add a new variable search
- create a condition, if not met, the system should run just as before
- if condition met : show the tasks that contains the word searched by the user


**EXTRA**
when we click to add a task the form is not beautifull for the user, we are going to improve that
STEP 4:
-run command (pip install django-crispy-forms) 
-run command (pip install crispy-bootstrap4)

STEP 5:
on the file settings.py (todo > todo> settings.py)
- add new app under list INSTALLED_APPS : ('crispy_forms',     'crispy_bootstrap4',)
- add a constant for it at end of file : (CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4' )

STEP 6:
on the files addtask.html and edittask.html (todo > tasks > templates > tasks > addtask.html AND edittask.html)
- add {% load crispy_forms_tags %} on the top to load that library
- change the  {{ form.as_p}} to {{ form|crispy}}
