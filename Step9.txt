STEP 1:
at file urls.py (tasks > urls.py)
- we are going to add a new path to be able to create new tasks

STEP 2:
on list.html (todo > tasks > templates > tasks >list.html)
- we add an ahref on the add button to direct ir for the url to add a new task

STEP 3:
on style.css (todo > tasks > static > css> styles.css)
- we add an formatting style for that a href we just ceated to avoid the underline

STEP 4:
now we are going to create the form to add new task
in django we need to create a Class for every form we are going to use
in the tasks folder (todo > tasks)
- we create a file called forms.py
- import the forms from django
- import our models (that will make easier, because it will respect the fields we have already)
- create Class (TaskForm)
- inside we create another Class (Meta)
- in Meta Class we are going to select th fields that we want to appear on the screen (title / description)

STEP 5:
on the views.py (todo > tasks >views.py)
- we import the class TaskForm from forms
- we import the function redirect from django.shortcuts
- update the function taskList to order the data by creation date
- create a new function called newTask
- check if request is POST
- if is validate we save the data and return to homepage
- if not that will ask you to fill the fields
STEP 6: 
on the tasks (todo > tasks > templates > tasks)
- create a file addtask.html
- here we are adding the tag form

*IMPORTANT* in django we must add the tag {% csrf_token %}  , because that protect the site of cross site request forgery
 is a secure random token that is used to prevent CSRF attacks

- add the tag {{ form.as_p}} that tag will print the form in paragraphs
- add input fields
